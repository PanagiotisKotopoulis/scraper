# Ethereum Web Scraper (Super Basic)

# Introduction

This is a basic web scraper with a lot of room for improvements based mostly on the youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY ) and has been adjusted to serve the sole purpose of checking the prize of Ethereum.
All the date are taken from yahoo finance and every 30 minutes the program checks if the price increases or decreases (user preference) and sends an email to notify the user of this change.
