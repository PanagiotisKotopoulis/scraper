# Ethereum Web Scraper (Super Basic)

# Introduction

This is a basic web scraper with a lot of room for improvements based mostly on the youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY ) and has been adjusted to serve the sole purpose of checking the prize of Ethereum.

All the data is taken from yahoo finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/cryptocurrencies) and every 30 minutes the program checks if the price increases or decreases (user preference) and sends an appropriate email to notify the user of the change.
